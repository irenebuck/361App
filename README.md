Who: As a child recently out of 2nd grade and entering 3rd grade, I want to practice my sight words over the summer break. 

What: This program cycles through @250 sight words taught in the Rocklin Unified School District to 2nd graders. 

Why: Children often forget some of what they are taught over the summer. This keeps the child current and fresh so they can hit the ground running in 3rd grade.

How: This program runs locally on your computer on the command line.
